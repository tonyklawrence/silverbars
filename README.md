## How to build / test

The chosen build system is gradle 6.3, this seemed to be the quickest and simplest option for this kotlin build.
Development was done using IntelliJ IDEA on MacOS, hopefully it will all work ok on Windows systems.  The gradle wrapper is included in the project so you can run the tests with the follow command:

    $gradlew test
